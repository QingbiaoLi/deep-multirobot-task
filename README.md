# deep-multirobot-task

TO-DO:
- [ ] One step optimization problem (each robot moves one step). 5 actiosn (stay included)
- [ ] 50 robots
- [ ] Environement size larger (how much)
- [ ] Greedy (actions providing maxmimal marginal gain) or random sampled action (say 1000 samples). Confirm with Lifeng 
- [ ] Using GNN
- [ ] Input includes relative locations of targets (euqal value) and robots within big square FoV. Big square: larger than fov, sweep the targets on FoV
- [ ] Adjacency matrix for each instance. If any robot is not connected to another discard that instance
- [ ]
