# deep-multirobot-task

TO-DO:
- [x] One step optimization problem (each robot moves one step). 5 actiosn (stay included)
- [x] 30 robots
- [ ] Environement size larger (how much) 200
- [ ] Greedy (actions providing maxmimal marginal gain) f(S union {a}) - f(S), S = S union {e}, and random sampled action (say 1000 samples, each robot has one action). Confirm with Lifeng 
- [ ] Input includes relative locations of targets (euqal value) and robots within big square FoV. Big square: larger than fov (2 + tracking length), sweep the targets on FoV
- [x] Check this first. define communication range. Adjacency matrix for each instance. If any robot is not connected to another discard that instance
- [ ] Using GNN
- [ ] Example test for overlaps of robots
